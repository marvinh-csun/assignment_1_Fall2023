# TASK COMMENT REST API AND FRONTEND APP

## Part 1
1. Create A Rest API Using any framework for backend that will create and display tasks. Each Task Should Be able to have comments under the task.

## Part 2
1. Create Frontend application to interact with the tasks.
2. Tasks should be reorderable by drag and drop interface I have provided algorithm that will work for reordering below
3. I recommend using https://dndkit.com if you are using a react frontend or https://github.com/Shopify/draggable (I have not used this personally) for vanilla js jquery frontend

### Display Order Algorithm
#### Can probably be adapted to any datastore or frontend logic
